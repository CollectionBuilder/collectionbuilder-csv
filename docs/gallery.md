# Gallery viewer

Powered by Spotlight gallery, https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight

Used to add full screen view to item pages, potentially with support for multiple images or for browse (not currently implemented, for example see items in [HJCCC](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/hjccc/)).

Add assets and basic initialization to any page by adding front matter `gallery: true`. 

The items to include in the gallery require a `a` around each individual image with `class="spotlight gallery-img"` plus `href=` with the link to higher quality image.

This is currently automatically added to item pages for objects with images.
