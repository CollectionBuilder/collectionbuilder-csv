## About this page ... 

Below is some information about OHD. To create your own About page for your project, just delete everything here and use Markdown to write your content. 

For more information on writing an about page, [see our CollectionBuilder documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/pages/interpretive/). OHD is built on CB, so you can use that documentation to edit it.

## About Oral History as Data

The [Oral History as Data (OHD)](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/) framework is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcripts collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included. 


## Documentation

- **[Full OHD Documentation](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/docs/) -** Our documentation provides how to guides, tutorials, and stepped instruction for building your own Oral History as Data project.  

- **[CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/docs/) -** OHD is built on top of a CollectionBuilder-CSV template, so any options used in CSV can be used here.
