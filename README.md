# Oral History as Data

This is the Template Repository for the Oral History as Data Project. You can "Use This Template" to copy the contents of this project and replace them with your own.

Oral History as Data (OHD) provides a static web framework for users to publish and analyze coded oral history and qualitative interviews on the web. 

You might also check out the [a demo site](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/emo) for this project. 

Here is some [documentation to get you started](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/docs). The documentation should help you create your content and metadata, and give you some ideas about how OHD is built and how it can be customized. 

### About Oral History as Data

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/). 

The project is closely related to the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project, and the current iteration was built on top of a CollectionBuilder-GH template.
